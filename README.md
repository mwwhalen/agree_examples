Here are some example AGREE models for teaching / learning the AGREE tool.  

## Directory structure

The models are in the 'models' directory, and documentation related to AGREE is in the 'documentation' directory.  

The primary pedagogical model is the Microwave: the structure is provided, and you, the user, need to fill in the guarantees necessary to perform the proofs.  The GPCA model is a large-scale model of an infusion pump, and the QFCS_V2 model is an example of a part of a quad-redundant flight control system developed by NASA and Sikorsky.  The Toy_Example is a simple model demonstrating how compositional verification works, and how the choice of types for input/output ports can lead to different answers. 

## Further information

To run the models, one needs the OSATE environment, available [here](http://www.osate.org).  Once OSATE is installed, follow the directions in the documentation/AGREE/Agree Users Guide.
